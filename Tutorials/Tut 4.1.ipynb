    "e) For the rest of the example we are going to couple the anabolic half reaction, with a catabolic half reaction where respiration occurs. There will thus be a glucose flux to biomass and to respiration. Note that all ATP produced must be consumed and that all NADH produced must be oxidised. Take the standard biomass formula where the the yield of $CO_2$ on biomass (for the anabolic half reaction) is 0.15 $\\frac{mol}{cmol X}$. Assume that the ATP required per cmol of biomass is 2.5 $\\frac{mol}{cmol X}$. Assume a $(P/O)_{NADH}$ and $(P/O)_{FADH}$ of 1.5. What fraction of the glucose is used for respiration [0.343]\n",
