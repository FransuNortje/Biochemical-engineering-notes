    "\n",
    "Before we go on to Chapter 6 we want to ensure that we have mastered the basic skills of playing with fermenter concentrations and rates in Jupyter notebooks. The purpuse of this tutorial is to improve your Python skills in this regard. So today we are more concerned about getting the right numbers than interpreting the numbers. Interpretation will follow later when  your notebook skillset is better developed. \n",
